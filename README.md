# Open Vessel Data Management v2.2

OpenVDMv2 is a ship-wide data management solution.  It is comprised of suite of programs and an accompanying web-application that provides vessel operators with a unified interface for organizing files created by multiple data acquisition systems into a single cruises data package while a cruise is underway.  Once the files are in the cruise data package they are immediately accessible by scientists.  In addition, vessel operators can configure OpenVDM to regularly copy the cruise data package to backup storage devices, external hard drives and even to shore-based servers.

Beyond this core functionally OpenVDMv2 includes a plugin architecture allowing vessel operators to install their own code to create simplified datasets for the purposes of visualizing, performing data quality tests and generating file statistics.

OpenVDMv2 also includes full RESTful API, allowing vessel operators to built their own custom web-based and stand-alone applications that leverage information stored within OpenVDMv2 for their own, vessel-specific needs.
